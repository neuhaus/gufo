# Qwen3.8 Flash-Next quality

**All 63 measured tg128 requests match fresh AR completions:** 21 AR,
21 mixed MTP and 21 repetitive MTP at C1/2/4/6/8. Unsloth UD-Q4_K_XL target,
shared Q8_0 MTP; [identities](artifacts/model-identities.json).
These are consistency checks, not original unquantized-model or GGUF-conversion
qualification. HTTP measurements: September 20–23, 2026; attention review:
September 27–28.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| MTP versus scalar CPU formulas, eight text/image states | Fusion/attention relative RMS <0.0008 (limit 0.002); full-width normalization, split projections, recursive carry and full Q8 head checked |
| Batched MTP/AR, C2/C4/C6/C8 | Logits, tokens, acceptance, RNG and every 1–8-token rollback prefix match isolated execution |
| Sampling | 25 AR/MTP configurations, including top-p zero; FP64 target filtering/CDF, p/q acceptance, residual correction, seeded replay and short token budgets pass |
| Greedy penalties | GPU selection matches CPU at every 1–7-row verification width, including FP32-sensitive ties; native tool/JSON constraints remain active. C2/4/6/8 outputs match the previous implementation; image/tool cancellation, RAM/disk restore and OpenAI SDK checks pass. [Evidence](artifacts/penalty-verification.json). |
| Prefill and cache | Full logits match across tested chunk boundaries, short tails and restored state through 4096 tokens |
| Seeded MTP cache rebuilding | Two seeds × 200 tokens replay exactly after different prefill splits, cache bypass and replacement. K/V-only prefill and compact catch-up preserve full-head candidates across 1/8/9/32/33-row chunks. [Evidence](artifacts/mtp-cache-replay.json). |
| Scalar versus bulk prefill, 2176 tokens | Same top-1; logit RMSE 0.18, not bit-identical |
| Serving | Cancellation, three-turn continuation, reasoning/tool history, concurrent image/text isolation and disk restart pass |
| Sparse attention | Independent FP64 operator error ≤2.83e-7 (limit 1e-6). At 32K/128K, 256 fixed-token code/prose rows: mean KL 5.82e-4 and 256/256 top-1 agreement with an FP64-attention diagnostic. [Evidence](artifacts/attention-tiles-review.json). |

The attention diagnostic retains the quantized weights and other native
operators. Regrouping FP32 sums can change long-context text across builds;
matched-prefill AR/MTP logits and sampled snapshot replay are exact at
32K/128K. Session tests also cover image/text restoration and C2/4/6/8.

Sampled MTP can consume different RNG draws from AR. Seeded replay requires
the same build, request budget, capacity and sampling configuration; live cost
timings only steer greedy decoding. Draft sampling uses the full Q8 head's
top 64 logits; upstream draft-sampler equivalence is not claimed.
MTP cache projections now keep the same arithmetic across prompt splits.
Older Flash-Next disk checkpoints are rejected and rebuilt once.

## Vision

**One Gufo encoder comparison fails:** relative L2 **6.47%** versus official
Transformers BF16, above the **5%** limit, on a 1024×1024 synthetic texture.
Both use the same converted GGUF weights. Against FP32, Gufo and Transformers
BF16 differ by **7.83% / 8.10%**, respectively. This is numerical drift, not an
image-answer score; **llama.cpp was not tested**. Optimizations retain native
embedding bytes but do not resolve this gap. [Evidence](artifacts/vision-parity.json).

## Reproduce

Tests live in [`tests/models/qwen38_flash_next`](../../../tests/models/qwen38_flash_next).
Use `--batch-only`, `--sampling-only`, `--prefill-only` or `--cache-only` on the
session test;
the snapshot test covers persistent image/text state. For independent MTP checks:

```sh
nix develop -c cmake --build --preset gpu-test \
  --target qwen38_flash_next_model_tests qwen38_flash_next_gpu_probe
nix develop -c build/gpu-test/tests/models/qwen38_flash_next/qwen38_flash_next_gpu_probe \
  --model "$MODEL" --mtp-model "$MTP" --mtp-audit
```

formulas supply independent predictor checks; pinned Transformers ignores MTP
weights. [Vision reproduction](../qwen3.8-27b/QUALITY.md#vision).

## Benchmark method

Gufo single-user TG refreshed September 27, 2026 (`f797b5b`); PP and other
measurements retain September 22–23 provenance. One warmed sample per point,
greedy, thinking off.
Single-user uses pp2048/tg128; MTP pp is the maximum across mixed/repetitive
workloads. C1/2/4/6/8 use the same d0 prompts; every session prefills before
measured tg128, with at most four prompt-tail tokens reevaluated. Rates sum
individual decode rates. Gufo d0/C1 agree within 0.4% with matching drafts/output.
Depth calibration depends on the ordered sweep. Paired speed controls use
the same depth list. Deep AR/MTP HTTP cache frontiers differ by one token;
exact replay is checked separately with identical prefill boundaries.
AR reference is llama.cpp b11069; MTP uses pinned `6fcaa16f`.
Loading: cold files, C1/MTP/capacity 262144. Memory: C1/AR/capacity 133121,
peak global HIP allocation including idle memory. Full commands, counts and
identities remain in [artifacts](artifacts/bench.json) and the
[benchmark workflow](../../../.agents/skills/benchmark-model/SKILL.md).
