# Qwen3.8-Flash-Next TP=2

Two-host tensor-parallel serving over RDMA: native InfiniBand, RoCE v2, or USB4
cables as RoCE v2 devices ([below](#usb4)). It serves Q4 and full
Q8, AR and MTP, images, concurrent requests and history reuse. It needs
libibverbs and the build option `GUFO_ENABLE_TP2_RDMA` (off by default). Its
measurements are in [EXPERIMENTS.md](EXPERIMENTS.md#tp2), not in the published
one-host tables.

## Build

```sh
nix develop --inputs-from .#tp2-rdma -c cmake --preset gpu-tp2
nix develop --inputs-from .#tp2-rdma -c cmake --build --preset gpu-tp2 --target gufo

# Release binary with TP2
cmake --preset release -DGUFO_ENABLE_TP2_RDMA=ON
cmake --build --preset release --parallel 4
```

## Run

Start rank 0 first, and rank 1 within 30 s. `RANK0_ADDRESS` is where rank 1
reaches rank 0's TCP bootstrap. Both ranks need the same model files and the
same `--tp-control-token`, `--context`, `--prefill-chunk`, `--sessions`, MTP
settings and `--mmproj` use; the handshake names any setting that differs.

```sh
# rank 0: public HTTP server
build/gpu-tp2/gufo serve llm --model "$MODEL" --speculative mtp --mtp-model "$MTP" \
  --tp-world-size 2 --tp-rank 0 --tp-bootstrap-port 18515 \
  --tp-control-port 18516 --tp-control-token SHARED_TOKEN --sessions 4

# rank 1: worker only, no public HTTP port
build/gpu-tp2/gufo serve llm --model "$MODEL" --speculative mtp --mtp-model "$MTP" \
  --tp-world-size 2 --tp-rank 1 --tp-bootstrap-host RANK0_ADDRESS \
  --tp-bootstrap-port 18515 --tp-control-port 18516 \
  --tp-control-token SHARED_TOKEN --sessions 4
```

The link uses port 1 of the host's only RDMA device; `--tp-rdma-device NAME`
and `--tp-rdma-port N` choose another. On InfiniBand it uses GID 0; on RoCE
(an Ethernet link layer) the port's RoCE v2 GID, preferring its IPv4 address's
GID. `--tp-gid-index` overrides that, and is needed when the port has several
candidates. Both ranks must use the same link layer. Each rank logs its choice as
`event=rdma_ready`. RoCE v2 is qualified over USB4 only.

### USB4

Two Strix Halo hosts linked by USB4 cables can run TP2 without network cards:
[thunderbolt-ibverbs](https://github.com/neuhaus/donnerkeule/tree/feat/write-striping)
turns each cable's DMA rings into RoCE v2 RDMA devices. Its write striping
spreads Gufo's single QP over every ring of every cable to the other host;
without it a QP stays on one ring (about 10 Gbit/s). With two 40 Gb/s cables
it reaches 44 Gbit/s one way. Load it with an IPv4 address on its
`roce_netdev` (a dummy netdev will do) and pick any of its devices:

```sh
sudo ip link add tbv0 type dummy
sudo ip addr add 10.77.0.1/24 dev tbv0 && sudo ip link set tbv0 up   # .2 on rank 1
sudo modprobe thunderbolt_ibverbs profile=linux_perf tbnet=prefer_rdma \
  lanes=2 register_verbs=1 roce_netdev=tbv0 native_write_striping=1
ibv_devices                        # usb4_rdma0 .. usb4_rdma3 with two cables
build/gpu-tp2/gufo serve llm ... --tp-rdma-device usb4_rdma0
```

Both ranks produce output identical to InfiniBand. Against FDR InfiniBand
(ConnectX-3, PCIe 3.0 x4), Q4 with a 25.8k-token prompt prefilled at 1824
against 1892 tok/s and decoded at 32.6 against 34.5 tok/s; USB4 costs more
CPU (several cores in kernel workers) and latency per exchange. The links
must train at 2 × 20 Gb/s; check `rx_speed` and `rx_lanes` in
`/sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/*/` after plugging.

Chat and raw completions (including `ignore_eos`), sampling, streaming, stop
sequences, tool calls, images (`--mmproj` on both ranks), cancellation,
`--request-timeout-ms`, history reuse and the disk cache (`--cache-disk` on
both ranks, each on its own disk) work as on one host.
A RAM cache above the automatic budget needs the same `--cache-ram-bytes` on
both ranks; the pair uses the smaller of the two ranks' limits.
Cancellations and timeouts take effect between model calls, so a long prefill
stops at its next chunk. Up to `--sessions` requests run at once, their
decoders batched; more wait up to `--max-pending`, the rest get HTTP 429.

Limits:

- A disagreement fails its request with HTTP 500. A lost peer or link makes
  both ranks exit with status 1; rank 0 first turns `/ready` red and gives
  failed requests a second to report. Run both ranks under a supervisor that
  restarts them (for example systemd `Restart=always`): each waits about 30 s
  for the other before loading the model, so restarted ranks pair up again.
  A peer that exits is noticed at once and a host that vanishes after about
  25 s; a living peer that falls behind, for example while its n-gram reads
  wait on a throttled SSD, is waited for up to 3 minutes.
- Each session holds a full-context state on each rank. Full Q8 (six `Q8_0`
  shards, which do not fit one host) at 262,144 tokens uses 87 GB of each
  host's 127 GB GPU memory with four sessions and 103 GB with eight.
- Where TP2 is still behind one host (gaps to close, not design choices):
  - No in-pass prompt checkpoint (`PrefillThrough`): the last prefill pass
    stops at the checkpoint boundary and snapshots there.
    `tp_executor_test` fails when the TP2 wrapper turns off a runner
    capability that is not listed there as such a gap.
  - A paired prefill chunk computes every row of the final layer, where one
    host skips the rows nothing reads.

## Design

**Partition.** Both hosts hold the whole checkpoint and each loads its share of
the split weights. Every routed and shared expert's intermediate dimension is
halved on quantization-block boundaries (a routed down projection in a 256-value
super-block type is refused at load); every rank computes all selected experts
on its half. Each GDN layer's 16 key heads and the 48 value heads that read them
(value head h reads key head h % 16) and each attention layer's two KV heads
with their query heads are split, and each rank keeps only its heads' KV cache
and recurrent state. The indexer, draft block, HC, embedding, PLE, LM head and
vision encoder are replicated.

**Exchange.** Each mixer block and each MoE ends in one exchange of partial
sums, 10 KiB per decode row. A stage kernel copies the partial to host memory
and raises a flag; a communicator thread writes it into one of the peer's three
receive windows with an RDMA write with immediate data, whose arrival is the
readiness signal; a one-wave kernel holds the stream until it arrives, and the
GPU adds the peer's partial straight from the window. The host queues a whole
forward without waiting. The rotating windows need no acknowledgement provided
the add of exchange k is queued before exchange k+2 starts. Each exchange
header carries the call's scope, an ordinal and the byte count; a mismatch
poisons the communicator. A sum of two operands keeps both ranks bit-identical;
TP2 and one host differ by reduction order. HIP graphs are off under TP2.

**Prefill overlap.** A prefill step of up to 4096 tokens runs as two trunk
batches a layer apart (one batch under 384 tokens), so each batch's exchange
crosses the link while the other computes; the results equal two steps of
those sizes bit for bit.

**Rank 1 as executor.** Rank 0 runs the ordinary scheduler, runner pool and
continuation cache through `TpMirroredRunner`. Just before each call that
changes model state, it sends the call to rank 1 over an authenticated TCP
control channel; rank 1's `TpExecutor` makes the same call on the same state,
and both ranks meet in the call's exchanges. Token selection reads only logits
and stays on rank 0. A request opens with `kSingle` (prompt, sampling
configuration and prepared images) and closes with `kEnd`. Mirrored calls:

- prefill chunks, single and batched advances, and single and batched
  multi-token MTP cycles. A cycle carries rank 0's sampler draw state so both
  ranks draw alike; a batch also carries the draft count rank 0 chose from its
  own cycle timings. A request with tools or a response format sends rank 1
  what its constraint was built from (tools, response format, tool choice),
  and rank 1 builds the same constraint with the same code, so it judges
  drafts as rank 0 does; a constraint without that source decodes one token
  at a time;
- state resets, and binding a state to its request's prompt context (images
  can reset the state);
- snapshot, restore, prefix reuse and cancellation preparation, each
  acknowledged by rank 1 before rank 0 continues; snapshot bytes stay on each
  host, and the budget is the smaller rank's (its automatic budget, or its
  `--cache-ram-bytes`).

Every model call binds the communicator's scope to its instruction's index on
both ranks. Rules the compiler does not enforce: every state-changing call must
pass through the wrapper; a request's cancellation check is never passed to the
model session, which could strand rank 1 inside an exchange; TP2 must not
change the cache's boundaries.

**Disk cache.** Each rank keeps its own half of a snapshot on its own disk.
Rank 0's continuation disk store decides what is saved, restored and evicted,
as on one host. Its file holds rank 0's half behind a header that names a
random file key; when it writes the file, rank 1 persists its half under that
key in the background. Snapshots taken for the disk cache are complete on
both ranks, so neither writer reads rows its session still shares.
Restoring a file restores both halves, rank 1's from
its own directory, acknowledged before rank 0 continues. Rank 1 bounds its
directory by least-recent use within its own `--cache-disk-bytes`; a missing,
corrupt or foreign half fails the restore on rank 1, which rank 0's store
treats as a miss (the state is reset on both ranks and prefilled). TP2 files
carry the rank in their cache identity, so neither a one-host server nor the
other rank restores them. Within one process, a file of a request rank 1
rejected is a miss, and a restore before the verdict depends on it.

**Agreement.** Both ranks digest every call and its result; `kEnd` carries rank
0's digest and call count, and rank 1 fails the request on a difference. Under
greedy decoding rank 1 also checks its own argmax against every token rank 0
advances. A capture carries the request's digest so far, and rank 1 captures
only a state both ranks reached the same way. Snapshots and released states
are reused at once, as on one host; a request that reuses what an unjudged
request left fails too if rank 1 later rejects that request, and a rejected
request's states and snapshots are not reused.

## Tests and probes

- `tp_control_test`, `tp_executor_test` (label `tp2`, in the CPU suite): the
  protocol, and the real scheduler and pool on rank 0 against an executor on
  rank 1 with a toy model, for every request kind, divergence and reuse rule.
- `qwen38_flash_next.tp_partition` and the attention, projection and routed
  operator tests: the split against the full kernels.
- `qwen38_flash_next_tp_probe` (`gpu-tp2`): prompt, decode and logit
  comparison on both ranks; `--split N` checks that a prefill does not depend
  on its steps (every layer's MoE input and output, and the logits, bit for
  bit), `--decode-tail K` compares decoding the last K tokens with
  prefilling them.
- `qwen38_flash_next_tp_batched_probe` (`gpu-tp2`): batched against serial
  decoding on both ranks without the serving stack; `--allreduce-bench N`
  times the exchange.
- `tools/bench/model-bench.py` launches both ranks through a `gufo.tp2`
  overlay in `bench.json` (`remote_host`, `bootstrap_host`, ports, token,
  container and binary); it runs single-user tables only.

## Qualifying a change

On both hosts, from one commit (record it and the binary hash):

1. The format check on a fresh copy of the tree, and the CPU suite and TP2
   tests above with no skips.
2. Two hosts, Q4 and Q8, AR and MTP, greedy: outputs repeat, AR and MTP agree,
   and prompts longer than one prefill chunk work.
3. Seeded sampling reproduces; streaming, stop sequences, a tool call and
   client disconnects during decode and prefill behave as on one host.
4. A multi-turn cached chat restores its whole prompt on replay; cached token
   counts match one host (outputs may differ after a few turns).
5. Two, four and eight concurrent requests, AR and MTP, each equal their
   one-at-a-time output, seeded sampled ones too; the queue bound returns 429;
   a long prefill runs beside decoders.
6. Images: a request, its cached repeat, a follow-up and two images in one
   request match one host's answers.
7. Disk cache (`--cache-disk` on both ranks): after both ranks restart,
   `tools/serving/check-continuation.py --restore` restores its greedy cases
   from disk with the same outputs.
8. Killing rank 1 mid-request returns 500 promptly, and rank 0 then exits
   with status 1; killing rank 0 makes rank 1 exit with status 1. SIGTERM
   stops either rank promptly.
9. For speed, report the median of several warm requests.
