# Qwen3.8 Flash-Next benchmarks

AMD Strix Halo `gfx1151`, 128 GB unified memory. Unsloth `UD-Q4_K_XL` target and
shared-Q8_0 MTP sidecar; Gufo uses adaptive MTP. HTTP, greedy, thinking off.
Positive gain favors Gufo.
[Quality and measurement details](QUALITY.md#benchmark-method) · [Model identities](artifacts/model-identities.json)

- [Single Strix Halo](#single-strix-halo): Gufo against llama.cpp.
- [Two Strix Halos over RDMA](#two-strix-halos-over-rdma): Gufo RDMA against
  Gufo on one host, deeper contexts, and the full Q8 model.

## Single Strix Halo

Gufo single-user pp/tg: October 7, 2026 (`def2ed1e`), Performance power
profile; concurrency, loading, memory and reference results: September 22–23.
Concurrency uses the unchanged short-context attention path. llama.cpp uses
`b11069` for AR and `6fcaa16f` for MTP.

### Single user, autoregressive

Approximately pp2048 / tg128; depth is the cached prefix in tokens.
Context capacities differ between engines; see the measurement details.

## Two Strix Halos over RDMA

Gufo RDMA runs one model on two such hosts: every layer is split between them,
and they exchange partial sums over RDMA ([how it works](TP2.md)).
The workloads are those of the one-host tables; "Gufo" is the same build on
one host, and gain is Gufo RDMA over it. With twice the memory, single users
also reach depths one host cannot (context capacity 262144). Every RDMA table
was measured on October 9, 2026 (`c85349b5`) over USB4 RoCE v2, with the
same-build one-host runs beside them, in the balanced power mode (85 W
sustained), so prefill is lower than in the one-host tables above; decode is
not power-bound. Over USB4 a fresh 2K prompt prefills more slowly than on one
host; with a cached prefix, prefill gains 3–15%.
